If you like the keyboard, please consider helping me with Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/bastardkb

I post regular updates and hindsight on my work. This helps a lot !

# Versions

V1:

- original version

V2:

- smoother
- should work with amoebas and flexible pcbs
- more screws !

# Sourcing the components

For sourcing the components, you have two options:

## Source them yourself

You will need to order the parts from a shop, and order some PCBs directly from the manufacturer.

The Elite-C Adapters are open-source. At this moment, the flexible PCBs are not.

**Note: please use Elite-C adapter V1.3**

**Note: the per-key RGB will not work at this point** - or you will need to solder cables to LED pads, this is difficult !!

Parts list:

| Part name  | Amount |  Link |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Amoebas  | 32  | |
| Elite-C | 2  | |
| Elite-C adapter PCB V1.3 | 2  | https://github.com/Bastardkb/Elite-C-holder |
| SOD123 Diodes | 32  | |
| FlexStrip cables | 30  | Farnell |
| M4 8mm Torx Screw | 12  | Conrad |
| M4 screw insert | 12  | Aliexpress |
| Audio jack, SMD | 2  |  |
